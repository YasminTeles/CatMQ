# Contribute to CatMQ

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug.
- Discussing the current state of the code.
- Submitting a fix.
- Proposing new features.
- Becoming a maintainer.

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests or merge request

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Use a consistent coding style

We define a code style, to use it try:

- If necessary, activate [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) in your IDE.
- You can try running `make lint` for style unification.

## Use a [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) rules. This format leads to easier:

- Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
- Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).
- Communicating the nature of changes to teammates, the public, and other stakeholders.
- Triggering build and publish processes.
- Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/YasminTeles/new-server/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/YasminTeles/new-server/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Report bugs

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
